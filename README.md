## Description

You have to successfully complete 2 levels to win.

Mario, which is the player is the box full of M's.

You cannot land on top of the large red pipe full of X's. It is a pipe out of which molten lava emanates out and instant death awaits anyone who lands on it, so beware.

The green '-' is your running area.

The green '-' lines are mini-bridges. They allow you to jump higher in order to collect the white 'V's which are gems. You cannot break a bridge. You can jump on top of them. You are also allowed to climb upon a bridge without a full jump. To do so, simply jump at a position adjacent to the bridge and direct yourself towards it and you will have climbed upon it. This is an additional characteristic of a bridge.

The white 'O's are the coins. Collect as many as you can.

The magenta 'X' are your minions enemies. They scout small areas assigned to them. The only way to kill them is to land on their head and knock them out. Any other collision will imply that they eat your brains, so beware.

Make sure you are not even partially upon the moat. The moats are death traps and any contact with them will hypnotise Mario causing him to lose consciousness and end up in the bottomless abyss. So, beware.

Finally, to pass a level, you must kill the commander. He is the boss who runs the show. Killing him is similar to killing a minion but you have to knock him out thrice.

Enjoy the journey. Its midnight on a new moon night. You can see some rain bearing clouds and the floating mountains of Pandora on the background.

Press 'Q' to end the game.

1. The commander is intelligent. It moves towards the player and can jump up in the air trying to chase the player but upto a certain height keeping playability in mind. It goes towards the player in an oscillatory motion. After you strike the commander twice and he has only a single life left, he increases his charging speed.

2. The minions move left and right within their domain.

3. The jump has a gravity like feel as you decelerate, stop in mid air, and fall down again.

4. The mario theme plays in the background. When you collect coins and gems or kill an enemy, there is a bell ringing sound. If you die, the corresponding sound is played and you get the victory track when you pass a level. The spring sound effect comes when Mario jumps.

5. The first level has a undwerwater scenery while the second is underground.

6. In level 2, the enemies move faster and the boss can jump up even higher making things worse for Mario.

7. The point system is as follows:
	Coin : 10 Rupees
	Gem : 500 Rupees
	Minion : 1000 Rupees
	Boss : 10000 Rupees

# Input Constraint:

It is advisable not to press and hold a key. You may end up going somewhere you do not want to. Keep in mind that mario moves three steps at a time so hitting the keys continuously is fine for rapid movement.

# Note:

Like real life, Mario has only a single life in the game. The game is small and just has two levels. Hence, I tried to make it challenging but keeping it winnable at each step. Hence, to win, one needs to be perfect.

Try to collect all coins and gems which are placed at the maximum possible heights upto which you can jump.

Open the terminal in fullscreen mode to play the game.

Enjoy.
